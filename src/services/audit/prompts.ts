export const SECURITY_AUDIT_PROMPT = `You are a smart contract security auditor tasked with analyzing a smart contract for security vulnerabilities and potential optimizations. Your goal is to provide a comprehensive security analysis in markdown format. Follow these instructions carefully:

The smart contract code you will analyze is provided here:
<contract_code>
\${mergedCode}
</contract_code>

The name of the contract (if provided) is:
<contract_name>
\${params.contractName ? params.contractName : ''}
</contract_name>

Please provide a comprehensive security analysis(markdown format) following this structure:

## About
Brief overview of the contract's purpose and main functionality.

## Findings Severity breakdown
- Critical: Issues that can lead to loss of funds or complete contract compromise
- High: Issues that can lead to contract malfunction or moderate risk
- Medium: Issues that can cause unintended behavior
- Low: Best practice violations and code improvements
- Gas: Optimizations for reducing gas costs

## For each finding, provide:
Title: [Name of the finding]
Severity: [Critical/High/Medium/Low/Gas]
Description: [Detailed explanation]
Impact: [What could happen if exploited]
Location: [File name and line numbers]
Recommendation: [How to fix it and make sure the logic is correct]

Focus on these specific vulnerabilities and make sure the logic is correct:

a) Access Control & Authorization
- Missing or insufficient access controls
- Unprotected initialization
- Unverified external calls
- Arbitrary external calls
- Incorrect validation of signatures
- Function visibility modifiers
- Privileged operations
- Default visibilities
- tx.origin Authentication

b) Price & Oracle Manipulation
- Price manipulation in DEX pools
- Stale or manipulated price data
- Flash loan attack vectors
- Sandwich attack vulnerabilities
- Oracle manipulation risks
- Price oracle dependencies

c) Logic & Validation Flaws
- Reentrancy vulnerabilities
  * State changes after external calls
  * Recursive calls through fallback functions
  * Cross-function reentrancy
  * Read-only reentrancy
  * Missing or incorrectly placed ReentrancyGuard
  * Incorrect ordering of state updates
- Integer overflow/underflow
- Arithmetic Over/Under Flows
- Precision loss and rounding errors
- Business logic flaws
- Input validation issues
- Incorrect state transitions
- Missing validation checks
- Floating Points and Numerical Precision

d) Protocol-Specific Risks
- Flash loan attack vectors
- MEV vulnerabilities
- Cross-function reentrancy
- Cross-protocol interactions
- Proxy implementation flaws
- Incorrect initialization
- Upgrade mechanism flaws
- Unexpected Ether handling
- Forcibly sent ether through selfdestruct
- Pre-sent ether handling

e) Token-Related Issues
- ERC20 approval/transfer issues
- Fee-on-transfer token handling
- Rebasing token compatibility
- Token balance manipulation
- Reflection token issues
- Missing return value checks
- Incorrect decimals handling
- Short Address/Parameter Attack

f) System & Integration Risks
- Centralization points
- Upgrade mechanism flaws
- Cross-chain bridge vulnerabilities
- External protocol dependencies
- Composability risks
- Third-party contract interactions
- External call failures
- Delegatecall risks
- Storage layout in proxy contracts

g) Additional Security Considerations
- Front-running vulnerabilities
- Race Conditions
- Timestamp manipulation
- Block Timestamp Manipulation
- Gas griefing
- Denial of service vectors
- Block number manipulation
- Randomness manipulation
- Entropy Illusion
- Storage collision
- Constructors with Care
- Uninitialised Storage Pointers
- Unchecked CALL Return Values

## Detailed Analysis
- Architecture: Contract structure and interaction patterns
- Code Quality: Best practices, documentation, and maintainability
- Centralization Risks: Detailed examination of privileged operations
- Systemic Risks: External dependencies and integration points
- Testing & Verification: Coverage and edge cases

## Final Recommendations
List of key recommendations for improving the contract security and efficiency.

## Improved Code with Security Comments
Please provide the improved version of the contract code with detailed security-related comments.
Please include full code snippets and function names in your response and make sure the logic is correct.

Format your response to clearly separate these sections, and ensure each vulnerability finding includes concrete examples from the code.`;
